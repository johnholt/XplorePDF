Learning to extract information from PDF files.
---
# Overview
This project uses SwiftUI to demonstrate how to extract information from PDF files.  The generated application runs on MacOS and iOS platforms.

The user selects files or drops files to be processed.  The application automatically extracts the metadata and provides a UI for the user to identify the title, authors, author supplied keywords, and abstract.

The application extracts and displays the file metadata and the PDF metadata on separate panels.  The application shows the PDF contents in the `PDFView` view from either AppKit or UIKit.
